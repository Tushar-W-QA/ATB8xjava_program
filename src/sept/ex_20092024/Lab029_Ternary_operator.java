        The ternary operator in Java is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement.
        Itâ€™s called the ternary operator because it takes three operands

        Syntax:
         condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false

         expression_if_true: The value returned if the condition is true.
         expression_if_false: The value returned if the condition is false
