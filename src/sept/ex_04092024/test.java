      1. Simple:
      Java is designed to be easy to learn and use.
      Its syntax is clean and straightforward, making it accessible for beginners.

      2. Object-Oriented
      Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language,
      which means it organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

      3. Platform Independent:
      Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
      This means you can write Java code once and run it anywhere.

      Example: You can write a Java program on a Windows machine and
               run it on a Mac or Linux machine without any changes.

      4. Secure:
      Java has built-in security features that help protect against threats like viruses and tampering.

      Example: Java’s security manager allows you to define what resources a Java application can access,
      such as reading or writing to the local disk.

      5. Robust:
      Java is designed to be reliable.
      It has strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking mechanisms.

      6. Multithreaded:
      Java supports multithreading, which allows us to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

      7. portable:
      Java programs can be easily moved from one computer system to another,
      thanks to its platform independence and the Java Virtual Machine.

      8. High Performance:
      Java’s performance is enhanced through the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers,
      which convert bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
