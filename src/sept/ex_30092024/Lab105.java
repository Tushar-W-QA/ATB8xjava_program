    // while and do while

//1. When we are using "for statement" or "while statement" then
// it verifies the condition before executing the block.

//2. So in the case of "for statement" and "while statement", when first time condition is false
// then the block will not be executed.

//- "for" and "while" statement are also called as **Entry Controlled Loop.**

    // do while
// In the case of "do-while" first block of statements will be executed and then condition will be verified
