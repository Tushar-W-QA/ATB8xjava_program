    // Abstraction is basically hiding and Enforcing something to user

    // Abstraction in Java is a concept in object-oriented programming
    // that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and
    // showing only the essential features of an object.
    // It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
    // Abstract Class can not be final
    // Abstract Class can not be initiated (can not instance of abstract class)
    // one Can not create the object of Abstract class
    // body of abstract method can not be implemented in abstract class

    // Rule:
    // 1. If any class doesn't have any abstract method then it is called as 'Concrete Class'.
    // 2. Abstract method is required the abstract class
    // 3. Non-Abstract method does not require abstract class (but we can use non-abstract method abstract class)
    // 4. We can not the following modifier with abstract class:
       // private, static, Final, Synchronised, native, Strictfp
